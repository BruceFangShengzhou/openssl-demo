1. compile source code which include openssl header files and link libcrypto.so and libssl.so, problems occurs as below:
    error: storage size of ‘ctrCtx’ isn’t known EVP_CIPHER_CTX ctrCtx;
2. read software release note and search the same problem in the internet, find that it could be system provided openssl's version does not match the source code's requirement
   where the source code expected openssl version is OpenSSL 1.0.2g
3. use command "openssl version" to confirm that system verison is OpenSSL 1.1.1f, we need to compile source code with OpenSSL 1.0.2g to confirm the root cause.
4. we download OpenSSL 1.0.2g from https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/7.9/postlfs/openssl.html, and compile it sa below:
   ./config --prefix=/usr --openssldir=/etc/ssl --libdir=lib shared && make
5. copy the header files under openssl/include to the source code include dir, and compile source code again
6. it works
